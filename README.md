# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using the Python programming language. The game is played in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## How to Play
1. Run the notebook and execute all the code cells.
2. The game will be displayed as a grid of 3x3 cells.
3. Player 1 will be represented by 'X' and Player 2 will be represented by 'O'.
4. Each player takes turns to place their symbol in an empty cell of the grid.
5. To place a symbol, enter the row and column number of the cell.
6. The game ends when one player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all cells are filled.
7. If there is a winner, the winner will be displayed. If the game ends in a draw, it will be displayed as well.
8. Play again by running the notebook again.
